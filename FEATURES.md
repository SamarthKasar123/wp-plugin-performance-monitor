## 🚀 Core Features

### 1. **Multi-Site Plugin Dashboard**
- **Centralized Monitoring**: Single dashboard for all your WordPress sites
- **Real-time Performance Scoring**: A-F grading system for plugin performance
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded alerts for security vulnerabilities and compatibility issues
- **Advanced Filtering**: Sort and filter by performance, memory usage, or security status

```php
// Example: Getting site performance summary
$sitePerformance = $this->analyzer->getSitePerformanceSummary($user['id']);
foreach ($sitePerformance as $site) {
    echo "Site: {$site['site_name']} - Grade: {$site['performance_grade']}";
}
```

### 2. **Performance Analytics Engine**
- **Plugin Impact Analysis**: Measure before/after performance when plugins are activated
- **Memory Usage Tracking**: Monitor PHP memory consumption per plugin
- **Database Query Analysis**: Track database queries and execution time
- **Load Time Monitoring**: Page load speed impact assessment

```php
// Example: Calculate performance score
public function calculatePerformanceScore($loadTime, $memoryUsage, $dbQueries, $errors = 0)
{
    $score = 4.0; // Start with perfect score
    
    // Deduct points based on performance metrics
    if ($loadTime > 1000) {
        $score -= min(2.0, ($loadTime - 1000) / 2000);
    }
    
    return max(0, round($score, 1));
}
```

### 3. **Security Vulnerability Scanner**
- **CVE Database Integration**: Check against known WordPress plugin vulnerabilities
- **Automated Security Scanning**: Daily scans for security issues
- **Risk Assessment**: Severity scoring (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- **Update Notifications**: Alerts when security patches are available

### 4. **Real-time Alert System**
- **WebSocket Integration**: Live notifications without page refresh
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Set custom alert triggers
- **Multi-channel Notifications**: Email, SMS, and in-dashboard alerts
- **Alert Prioritization**: Critical issues bubble to the top

```javascript
// Example: Real-time alert handling
async checkForNewAlerts() {
    const response = await fetch(
        `?page=dashboard&action=getLiveAlerts&last_check=${this.lastAlertCheck.toISOString()}`
    );
    const data = await response.json();
    
    if (data.success && data.alerts.length > 0) {
        this.displayNewAlerts(data.alerts);
    }
}
```

### 5. **Advanced Reporting Engine**
- **Executive Summaries**: High-level reports for clients and stakeholders
- **Technical Deep Dives**: Detailed performance analysis for developers
- **Trend Analysis**: Performance changes over time
- **Export Capabilities**: PDF, CSV, JSON formats

### 6. **WordPress REST API Integration**
- **Secure API Communication**: OAuth and token-based authentication
- **Plugin Data Sync**: Automatic synchronization of plugin information
- **Custom Endpoints**: Extended WordPress API for monitoring data
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect WordPress API limits
